BRAINSTORM-MAIN:



REQUIREMENTS:

- make an application?
- has to be based in coding (hopefully c++)



IDEAS:

- website that given certain inputs about what you need in a car will return an ordered list of what cars you should consider buying
	-> this is mainly a CS project and doesn't really have a lot to do with ME

- make something that helps mechanical engineers answer a specific car related question?
  -> likely extremely difficult and probably based mostly in CS concepts


physical analysis of a situation:

- analyze the predicted internal pressure of differently shaped vessels as they go deeper and deeper into the ocean
	-> how does this change as you add various internal supports?
	-> how does this change as you add various external supports (eg. "barrel hoops" that are seen on brewing barrels)?



- stress analysis of a beam or other item
  -> the stress that a beam experiences when a load is applied to it at different points along its body
