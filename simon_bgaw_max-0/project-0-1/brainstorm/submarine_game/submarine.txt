SUBMARINE.TXT

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:

1) probably don't want to be dragging the submarine around -- from depth x to depth x' -- and instead better to type in the new depth and have the simulation move the submarine over a period of time.




PHET-LIKE SUBMARINE SIMULATION:

output parameters?
	-> pressure experienced by the inner hull
	-> pressure outside of the vessel (the pressure that would be experienced by the fish swimming around out there)

input parameters?
	-> depth of the submarine
	-> salinity of the water?

different conditions under which the simulation operates?

	-> shape of the vessel
	-> internal and/or external hull supports
	-> thickness of the hull(s)
	-> volume of the bouyance chambers
	-> type of gas being used in the bouyancy chambers


POSSIBLE CONDITIONS TO CHANGE - MAKE IT INTERESTING:

experiment with different hull shapes and thicknesses ... 

experiment with different internal and external supports for the submarine ...
