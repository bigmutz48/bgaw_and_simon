SONAR.TXT

simulate underwater sonar activity in c++:
	-> this would mostly be cs with very little physics stuff


Simulate two underwater vessels communicating using radio or sonar?


Simulate two submarines looking for eachother?
	-> could get a basic AI to drive one of them and have the weird ass scaning sonar for your submarine
	-> possibly get a game that two people can play on two seperate computers
		-> each player is looking for the other and trying to distinguish between
     	-> only 2d the player can only see the instrument read out

	-> hardest part of this will be trying to incorporate in ME concepts and physics
		- really for every idea we've had ... there will be more than enough for me to do ...
		so the limiting factor is going to be finding something that has ME and physics concepts
	-> player would be able to just see an instrument read out and would only exist in two dimensions

INCORPORATING ME/PHYSICS CONCEPTS:

- complex instrument read outs

- differing sonar mechanics at different depths
	-> how does the depth affect the ability of the player to navegate using sonar?


- try to simulate the actual ballast tanks and simulate/calculate water and air ratios?
